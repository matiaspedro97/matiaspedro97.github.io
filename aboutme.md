Hey there! 🎉 So, picture this: I’m a **Biomedical Engineering** wizard, armed with an **MSc degree** from **NOVA University of Science and Technology**. But wait, there’s more! I’m not just your average brainiac: I’m *proactive*, *motivated*, and *always up for a challenge*. Think of me as the determined **problem-solver**! 💪

Now, here’s the magic: I’ve got a special thing for **data science**, and already learned tons of tricks by using **AI**, **Machine Learning** applied to research/industry sectors. But guess what? My interests don’t stop there. I’m all about enchant with **AI magic** across different tech fields, making the world a smarter, cooler place. 🌟

When I’m not geeking out over algorithms, you can find me hanging out at the **beach** 🏖️, hanging out with **friends** 🥳, or getting my game on in **sports** ⚽. And who doesn’t love to stay in a quieter evening watching a **movie** 🎬 or getting lost in a good **book**? 📚 Yep, that’s my idea of a perfect day off.

So, if you’re into brainy AI matters, outdoor adventures, or just chilling out, hit me up! Let’s make some magic happen together. ✨
